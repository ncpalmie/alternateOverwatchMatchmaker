# alternateOverwatchMatchmaker
Matchmaker designed for Blizzard's Overwatch, hopefully better at matching evenly skilled players than current in-game matchmaker. 
Allows for scraping from https://overbuff.com using Selenium and chromedriver for most up-to-date community stats. 
Purely for fun as of right now, until Blizzard fleshes out Overwatch API and allows for personal servers, if ever. 
Very heavily WIP currently.
